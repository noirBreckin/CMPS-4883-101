I personally think that we should stick with UVA online judge. As clunky and annoying as it is, the big list of options that we have for easy breezy isn't something I really want to give up. Three weeks in we surely all have managed to register for UVA and have gotten used to working it thanks to the hashmat problem. As for what to do as a class, I'm not sure. I think we all can agree that we aren't picky about what we do in class but sticking with easy breezy as it is will be the best course of action in my opinion.
