Another problem I solved and completed for easy breezy is LeetCode problem 367 "Valid Perfect Square".

Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.
